     <h2>an now, banana facts</h2>

   <p>
    1. The banana fruit got its name after being sold wrapped in aluminum foil for 10 cents at the 1876 Philadelphia World Fair.
    2. The classic banana species we consumed was called the Gros Michel. It was sweeter and creamier than the modern banana. However, due to a devastating disease in 1965, farmers switched to the current variety, the Cavendish.
    3. There are over 1000 different varieties of bananas worldwide, divided into 50 groups. The most common and widely exported type is the Cavendish banana.
    4. Bananas are scientifically classified as berries, while strawberries are not. A berry must contain seeds inside the flesh, not outside.
    5. Eating bananas may lower the risk of stroke and heart attack due to their potassium content. They help prevent stiffness in the aorta and hardening of the arteries.
    6. Singers Alicia Keys, Adele, and Katy Perry all have bananas as part of their backstage demands when performing.
